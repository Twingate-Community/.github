# Twingate-Community Org

Welcome to the community-powered side of Twingate‚Äîwhere creative ideas, side projects, and integrations come to life.

This org is for folks who love building, tinkering, and experimenting with new ways to use Twingate‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre running a homelab, self-hosting apps, or exploring modern access for your personal setup or community project.

We focus on:

- üß© **Self-hosted integrations**: Add-ons, plugins, and scripts that bring Twingate into tools like Home Assistant, Proxmox VE, Unraid, and beyond
- üîå **Networking & automation tools**: Helpers for deploying, managing, or enhancing Twingate in homelab environments
- üß™ **Creative workflows**: Experiments, demos, and ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù projects that test new use cases and push the edges of Zero Trust

## Just hacking around? You‚Äôre in the right place.

Whether you‚Äôre solving a specific problem or just seeing what‚Äôs possible, this is a place for curiosity, exploration, and sharing. Many of these projects are community-driven or started as weekend experiments‚Äîso if you see something cool, fork it, remix it, or contribute back!
